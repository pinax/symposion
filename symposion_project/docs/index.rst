Pinax Symposion
===============

Pinax Symposion is an open-source Django project for conference websites.

It came out of development done by Eldarion for DjangoCon US and US PyCon
but has been independently used for a number of other conferences.

We are in the process of cleaning things up and making them more generic.

The project homepage is http://pinax.github.com/symposion/
