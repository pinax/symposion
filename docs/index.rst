About
-----

Symposion came out of development done by Eldarion for DjangoCon US and US PyCon
but has been independently used for a number of other conferences.
The project homepage is http://eldarion.com/symposion/

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symposion does not include support for conference registration. An independent
project, Registrasion, can be used to add conference registration features to
your Symposion site. Registrasion can be found at
