Here's a brief summary of what you need to do to release a program under one of our licenses:

Get a copyright disclaimer from your employer or school.

Give each file the proper copyright notices. Make sure to clearly identify which versions of the license users can use.

Add a COPYING file with a copy of the GNU GPL or GNU AGPL.

Also add a COPYING.LESSER file with a copy of the GNU LGPL, if you use that.

Put a license notice in each file.

(Optionally) make the program display a startup notice.

(If using the AGPL) make the program offer copies of its source code.

This involves adding two elements to each source file of your program: a copyright notice (such as “Copyright 1999 Terry Jones”), and a statement of copying permission, saying that the program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (or the Lesser GPL, or the Affero GPL).

The copyright disclaimer

If you are an individual, and you have an employer or study in a school, it's wise to ask your employer or school to sign a copyright disclaimer for your program, so it cannot later claim that the copyright belongs to it and that you had no right to release the program at all. This really has nothing to do with the GNU GPL—it applies no matter which free software license you use to release the program.

Here is a sample copyright disclaimer; just alter the names, title, and program description as appropriate:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program “Woodpecker” (which deconstructs trees) written by James Hacker.

signature of Moe Ghoul 1 April 1989

If you are a university student, we recommend you request the disclaimer at an early stage in writing the program to reduce resistance. If you are not a research assistant or teaching assistant, it could be that the university has no claim to copyright on your work, but ask a lawyer to make sure of that.

If you work, the best time to negotiate permission to release free software is when negotiating your employment agreement.
